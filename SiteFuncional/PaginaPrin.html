     <h1 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 35px;">Introduction</h1>
     <p style="padding-left: 450px; padding-top: 75px;"> But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? <br>
        It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. <br>
        Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, <br>
        Who is already sick and pale with grief, <br>
        That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she. 
        Be not her maid, since she is envious; <br>
        Her vestal livery is but sick and green <br>
        And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. 
        It is my lady, O, it is my love! <br>
        O, that she knew she were! <br>
        She speaks yet she says nothing; what of that? <br>
        Her eye discourses; I will answer it. 
        I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks. <br>
        Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, <br>
        Having some business, do entreat her eyes <br>
        To twinkle in their spheres till they return. 
        What if her eyes were there, they in her head? <br> 
        The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, <br>
        As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven <br>
        Would through the airy region stream so bright <br>
        That birds would sing and think it were not night. <br>
        See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! <br>
        O, that I were a glove upon that hand, <br>
        That I might touch that cheek! 
        ...
        She speaks! <br>
        O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art <br>
        As glorious to this night, being o'er my head <br>
        As is a winged messenger of heaven <br>
        Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes <br>
        Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him <br> 
        When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds <br>
        And sails upon the bosom of the air.</p><br>
